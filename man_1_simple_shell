.SH NAME
hsh - Simple Shell. Command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
Run ./hsh [command] [argument] for interactive mode and echo "[command] [argument]" | ./hsh for non-interactive mode.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple Shell is a command line interpreter developed in C language that emulates the most basic functionality of "sh".

.SH COMPILATION
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

.SH MODES
The shell can be used in interactive or non-interactive mode. The interactive mode is how the shell is normally used, the executable file is run and we can write commands. In the non-interactive mode you pass the command to the executable file with a pipe operator. In the "EXAMPLES" section you can see how to use them.
